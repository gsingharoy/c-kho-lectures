# Functions exercsies

### 1. The reverse function
Try to solve this by recursively as well.
```ruby
# reverse([1, 2, 'a', 'b']) => ['b', 'a', 2, 1]
# Do not use the ruby reverse function ;)
def reverse(arr)
  # Enter code here
end
```

### 2. The odd sum function
This can also be done recursively.
```ruby
# Sum of all the odd numbers in the array
# odd_sum([3, 5, 2, 4, 1]) => 3 + 5 + 1 => 9
def odd_sum(arr)
  # Enter code here
end
```

### 3. prime function
```ruby
# Returns a boolean value which is true when the num is prime
# prime(10) => false
# prime(51) => false
# prime(7) => true
# prime(1) => false
def prime(num)
  # Enter code here
end
```
Can you try to solve this using a recursive function as well ?

### 4. fibonacci series
```ruby
# Returns a fibonacci series of the length num
# fibonacci(3) => [0, 1, 1]
# fibonacci(10) => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
def fibonacci(num)
  # Enter code here
end
```
Try to also solve this using a recursive function.
